1. Currently, the renderqueue only has 1 animation at any one time. In this case, removing the render function from the render queue is easy
   - simply remove the first function in the queue.
   If we have multiple animations concurrently, how do we remove a render function? A simple way is to iterate throught the render queue.
   Is there a better way?
